My name is Gabe Mancino-Ball. I am currently a data scientist at [Evonik](https://corporate.evonik.com/en). I like using [mathematical tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization#:~:text=Mathematical%20optimization%20(alternatively%20spelled%20optimisation,discrete%20optimization%20and%20continuous%20optimization.) to solve machine learning and data science problems. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out over LinkedIn.
